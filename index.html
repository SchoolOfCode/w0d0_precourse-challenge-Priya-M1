                <br>
                <p1 class="intro1"> David Attenborough, broadcaster natural historian, author and a <strong>national treasure</strong>.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="intro2" id="tribute-info">Studying the natural sciences at the University of Cambridge, broadcaster David Attenborough began his career as a producer at the BBC, where he launched the successful Zoo Quest series. Attenborough was made controller of BBC Two in 1965 and later was named its director of programming. During his tenure, the station crossed over to colour television, and Attenborough was instrumental in expanding its natural history content. <br> Attenborough left the BBC to begin writing and producing various series, including the smash hit Life on Earth, which set the standards for the modern nature documentary. Since then Attenborough has written, produced, hosted and narrated countless award-winning, nature-focused programs and has devoted his life to celebrating and preserving wildlife.
